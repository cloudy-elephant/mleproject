This is a MLE project which is about a pipline of predict customer whether churn or not.

What u need to do is:
    -open cmd
    -type: "docker compose build"
    -typr: "docker compose up"

When env finish building, there would be a tip: "Airflow is ready http://localhost:8080" Then you can press and hold the Ctrl key and then click the left mouse button. It will relocate u to the Airflow UI, the account name is: "admin" and the passcode is also "admin" Then u can view the dag flow.
